# Machine-Learning_classification

### Classification is one of the most widely used techniques in machine learning, with a broad array of applications, including sentiment analysis, ad targeting, spam detection, risk assessment, medical diagnosis and image classification. The core goal of classification is to predict a category or class y from some inputs x. I am familiar with the fundamental models and algorithms used in classification, as well as a number of core machine learning concepts. Rather than covering all aspects of classification, I also focus on a few core techniques (Decision Tree, boosting, precision-recall), which are widely used in the real-world to get state-of-the-art performance. By following these hands-on approach, I can implement your own algorithms on multiple real-world tasks, and deeply grasp the core techniques needed to be successful with these approaches in practice.
